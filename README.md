# cub3d

cub3D is a school project that emulates the raycasting techniques used in classic first-person shooter games like Wolfenstein 3D. It creates a 3D perspective from a 2D map and allows you to navigate through maze-like environments.

## Features

- Raycasting rendering engine
- Textured walls and sprites
- Player movement with keyboard and mouse input
- Collision detection
- Map parsing from a configuration file
- Adjustable resolution and textures
- Mini-map display

## Compilation

1. Clone the cub3D repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/AxelBadam/cub3d.git`



Compile the project:

bash
Copy code
$ make
Run cub3D with a sample map:

bash
Copy code
$ ./cub3D maps/sample.cub
